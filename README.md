# HTML Practical Work â„–1

## Objective
The objective of this practical work is to create an HTML page that fully utilizes the capabilities of HTML versions 5, 5.1, 5.2, and 5.3. The task emphasizes the correct and semantic use of HTML elements while avoiding CSS or JavaScript.

## Overview
In this practical task, the focus is on using a wide range of HTML tags to build a web page that follows modern HTML standards and is semantically correct. The task involves working with metadata, structural elements, lists, forms, multimedia, and semantic tags, without utilizing external stylesheets or JavaScript.

### Requirements:
1. **Choose a topic from the provided list** and disclose it using all HTML versions 5, 5.1, 5.2, and 5.3.
2. **Head Element:**
   - Use `<title>` for the page title.
   - Define `<link rel="shortcut icon">` for a favicon.
   - Set appropriate `<meta>` tags for:
     - Name attributes: `description`, `author`, `viewport`.
     - Open Graph properties: `og:title`, `og:type`, `og:url`, `og:image`, `og:description`.
3. **HTML Tags:** Utilize the following tags throughout the page:
   - Text formatting: `<h1> - <h6>`, `<hr>`, `<p>`, `<br>`, `<pre>`, `<i>`, `<em>`, `<b>`, `<strong>`, `<small>`, `<del>`, `<ins>`, `<sub>`, `<sup>`, `<q>`, `<blockquote>`, `<abbr>`, `<address>`, `<cite>`, `<dfn>`, `<div>`, `<span>`.
4. **Lists and Hyperlinks:**
   - Use all types of lists (ordered, unordered, and definition lists), as well as nested lists.
   - Incorporate hyperlinks with the `target` and `title` attributes, and use `mailto:`, `tel:`, `#`, `https:` links.
5. **Images and Captions:**
   - Use `<figure>` and `<figcaption>` for image descriptions.
   - Use the `<picture>` tag for responsive images.
6. **Semantic HTML Tags:**
   - Include tags such as `<article>`, `<aside>`, `<details>`, `<figcaption>`, `<figure>`, `<footer>`, `<header>`, `<main>`, `<nav>`, `<section>`, `<time>`.
7. **Anchor Links:** 
   - Ensure that `<a>` elements include `mailto:`, `tel:`, `#`, and `https:` links.
8. **No Use of CSS or JavaScript:** 
   - Focus on semantic correctness without adding any CSS or JavaScript.
9. **Folder Structure:**
   - Ensure there is a folder called `images` or `img` containing the images used in the page.
   - Create an `index.html` file that includes all the required elements.

## Tasks
### Task 1: Topic Selection
Choose a specific topic from the list provided and develop a web page that highlights the topic using HTML elements from versions 5 to 5.3.

### Task 2: Head Metadata
Ensure that the `<head>` element includes:
- A descriptive `<title>`.
- A favicon defined with `<link rel="shortcut icon">`.
- Proper `<meta>` tags for description, author, viewport, and Open Graph (OG) data.

### Task 3: Tag Usage
Implement various HTML tags as outlined in the requirements. This includes using all types of lists, nested lists, image captions, and semantic tags for proper structure and presentation.

### Task 4: Create the Index File
Build a file `index.html` with all the elements described. Ensure the page is semantically correct and accessible.

### Task 5: Folder Structure
Create a folder called `images` or `img` where all the image files used on the page are stored.

## Usage
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
